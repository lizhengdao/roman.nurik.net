The Google I/O Android app is a Developer Relations-run project that serves two purposes:

* Help Google I/O attendees and remote viewers personalize their conference agenda and explore conference content before, during, and after the event.
* Be an excellent open-source example of Android design and development best practices

My role has primarily been lead designer and frontend engineer, most notably for the 2014 app, which was one of the very **first Android apps to adopt material design**. For two years, I was also the overall technical lead for the app. In 2015, I acted primarily as UX mentor/advisor.
