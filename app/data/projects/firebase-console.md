I'm currently a design lead and manager on the Firebase UX team, focusing on the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com) design system (components, spec documentation, Sketch UI kit) and other platform-level design and UX engineering projects.

Previously, I was UX lead for [Firebase Remote Config](https://firebase.google.com/products/remote-config/), [A/B Testing](https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config/abtest-config), the console onboarding experience, our UI prototyping system, the [Firebase plugin for Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/firebase.html), and other smaller projects.
