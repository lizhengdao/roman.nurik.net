  caption: I obsess over details. Here's a screen in Muzei I'm really proud of, where the seekbars visually represent their corresponding effect. [See on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/1445180-Muzei-Live-Wallpaper-Advanced-Settings)

My philosophy for design and developer advocacy is to [create big, real-world demos](https://medium.com/google-developers/walk-then-talk-3b935bfe5484) and use them as fodder for content creation; walking the walk gives you more credibility.

Muzei is one of the larger apps I've written that epitomizes this philosophy. I [came up with the idea for the app](https://medium.com/google-developers/serendipitous-ideas-3a1721a6f716), designed, developed, launched, and open-sourced it over the course of 4 months.

Since the original launch, I updated some of the custom visual language in the app to include material design elements.

Muzei has been installed over a million times on Google Play.
